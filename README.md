#HACKATHON TASK

##Installation Steps:
1. Clone this branch into your local machine: https://github.com/Integr8-D-S/hackathon.git
2. ⁠Run `npm install`.
3. ⁠Create a new development git branch, and checkout into it.
4. ⁠Run `pm run dev`.
5. Now go to this path: `/src/App.jsx` and try debug the task.
6. Once completed, git push your code still from your development branch and create a pull request via GitHub immediately after making the push.

##The Task:

In the homepage you would see, I want to create a dynamic form which is being generated from an external api (https://estatelex.com.ng/api/role/create). You can enter this URL in your browser URL to see the api data structure. (Hint: Click on "pretty print" if you are using Chrome browser)

Below is an example of how I expect the form to look like:

Each rows are grouped and have checkboxes for their own individual groups. Try to see if you can make it look that way as in the pics using React, as the image you are seeing is a form I did using pure HTML/CSS/PHP handling.

Hint: From my attempt of trying to do the same with React, I believe the issue is how React is collecting the api data and if its properly accessing those data structures in that dynamic form. 

Hint: Make use of console.log in order to check for bugs as well

GOOD LUCK!
